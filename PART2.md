## Problems Encountered & Solutions

1. Problem  : Alien movement error where after the initial move, the next move start from the starting position again.
   Solution : I spent 1 hour or more just to realise I forgot to put an ampersand(&) at the alien parameter at the function oneTurn().
2. Problem  : We overcame segmentation fault frequently.
   Solution : We tried to overlook again into the vector dimensions.
3. Problem  : We encountered a lot of problems regarding the zombie behaviour such as their hitpoints, cannot disappear when hp become 0 and many more.
   Solution : No solution, we end our project here.
